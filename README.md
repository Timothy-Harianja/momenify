### Momenify

Project Idea:
Creating a social meadia online platform for everyone to meet new people directly. For an example, on most social media website like Facebook, you have to add people as friend to see their posts and message them. While on our website, we don't apply these restriction, you can see people's post directly on the homepage without login, and you can post something anonymously once in couple hour. If a user login with an account, you can do more things such as post unlimited time, and you can comment and like someone's post, and you can message people or follow them.
