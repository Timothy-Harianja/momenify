          Momenify provide a limited licence to Momenify users, who are
          permitted only to view, download to a web browser cache and print
          pages from the Momenify. Streaming and access to other website
          services may also be included in the permitted uses. Uses that may be
          expressly banned include republishing or selling website information
          and commercial uses.

          The Momenify contain additional restrictions on use of the Momenify,
          which include prohibitions on uses that harm the website or harm
          people, that constitute fraud or are otherwise against the law, or
          that spread malware or that involve systematic data gathering. Other
          potential prohibitions include using robots and using information from
          the site for direct marketing.

          The Momenify require users wishing to access Momenify functionality to
          register an account, and to secure their passwords. Users must be
          above a minimum age and a residency requirement may be included. By
          using the site, users implicitly agree to the Momenify and they should
          be asked to expressly agree to the Momenify upon registration.

        <body id="body">
          Certain hazards are inherent in Momenify. For instance, derogatory
          messages may be posted by users, including messages that might be
          actionable. The Momenify contain an explicit agreement from the user
          that the user will not take action against the Momenify in respect of
          such posts.

          Although users provide a licence to the Momenify and waive various
          rights with respect to what they post to the site, users remain
          responsible for their content. This content must observe strict
          limitations: in sum, user posts must not be contrary to law or deemed
          otherwise undesirable. The Momenify provide further details on these
          restrictions, which prohibit in particular libel, obscenity,
          violations of intellectual property rights, negligence, hate speech
          and numerous other illegal and unlawful acts. The Momenify retains the
          right to edit or remove user content and to block a user's access to
          the site.

          agree that the Momenify will not be held liable for any damage caused
          by their violation of the Momenify or their use of the Momenify site.
          The Momenify may modify periodically in its discretion. The Momenify
          provide the option as to how to notify users of any changes and obtain
          their agreement to the updated Momenify. The Momenify may also
          transfer its rights under the contract in its discretion.
